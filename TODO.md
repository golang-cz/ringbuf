- [x] Batch writes/reads
- [x] Test `writePos` (`uint64`) overflow thoroughly (affects MaxLag + batch reads)
- [ ] Tune the write batch loop by replacing loop with `copy()` (handle buffer overflow)
- [x] Finish `.Close()` semantics in regards to subscribers - do we let them finish reading data and only stop new writes?
- [ ] Revisit `.Skip()` method. Enable "bisect" (binary search) where user would be able to tell if it's too low or too high. Or let them rewind or fwd, perhaps by returning number?
